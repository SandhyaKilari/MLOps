# MLOps - Linear Regression Models

## Overview
This repository contains linear regression models built on `sampregdata.csv`. Two models are trained using scikit-learn:
- **Model 1**: Trained with a best single feature ('x4').
- **Model 2**: Trained with two best features ('x4' and 'x2').

## Model Comparison
Model 2 outperforms Model 1 by leveraging additional data (an extra feature). While Model 1 is simpler and may be easier to interpret, Model 2 provides better predictions for complex scenarios. Both models are version-controlled for reproducibility.
